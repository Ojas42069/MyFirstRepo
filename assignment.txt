Python Code simulating an ATM 

balance = 5000
amount = float(input("Enter amount to withdraw: "))
if amount > balance:
    print("Not enough balance")
else:
    balance -= amount
    print(f"Withdrawal successful. Remaining balance: ₹{balance}")


This code simulates a very simple ATM withdrawal:

balance = 5000 → sets the starting account balance.

amount = float(input("Enter amount to withdraw: ")) → asks the user how much they want to withdraw and converts the input to a number.

if amount > balance: → checks if the withdrawal amount is greater than the available balance.

print("Not enough balance") → runs if there isn’t enough money in the account.

else: → runs if there is enough money.

balance -= amount → subtracts the withdrawn amount from the account balance.

print(f"Withdrawal successful. Remaining balance: ₹{balance}") → displays the remaining balance after successful withdrawal.


Thank You!
